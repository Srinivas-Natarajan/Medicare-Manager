## Abstract <br/>
<p style="text-align: justify">  
In the modern medical world, doctors are aided by a wide variety of tools, machines and software. This advancement in technology has facilitated the large-scale collection, storage and processing of medical data from patients. With the increasing demands being placed on medical staff which is only getting worse amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for medical personnel to keep track of this data. Due to the high complexity and rise of data in healthcare, Software has become a very integral part of healthcare and is increasingly being applied within the field to solve the complex problems of Hospital Management. This is being done by increasing availability of healthcare data and rapid progress of analytics techniques i.e. boosting the efficiency of patient analysis. We have made a Hospital Management Application which can be used by many hospitals to maintain their databases more efficiently. This Application mainly helps to make the lives of patients easier by collecting all the important information required for a patient into a single place and therefore saving a lot of time. One of our reasons to make this is that due to a lot of steps before a patient is admitted or treatment of a patient starts, their condition sometimes takes a fatal and non-recovering turn as we have seen in the case of COVID-19, where a lot of patients are losing their lives because of waiting outside of hospitals.
